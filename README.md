# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game project! This project implements a simple browser-based Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

## How to Play

1. Each player takes turns clicking on the grid to place their marker (X or O).
2. The first player to get three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
3. If all cells are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
